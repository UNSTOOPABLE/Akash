[About]
This ASI plugin doubles the amount of packfiles (aka RPFs) the game can handle.
Please note that this plugin will only 'fix' ERR_FIL_PACK_1, nothing else. Get a better gameconfig and install the Heap Limit Adjuster if you still experience crashes.
Also, please make sure to combine your DLC packs. Not doing so is the most common reason for ERR_FIL_PACK_1.
And don't blame me if it doesn't help. I can't fix laziness.
